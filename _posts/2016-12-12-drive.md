<p>
I was looking into installing Google Drive on my Ubuntu 16.04 machine, but unfortunately, Google does not have an official Google Drive client for Ubuntu. I found some other third party clients like Gnome control center (free, but has limited features), Grive (not available for 16.04), Insync ($25) and OverGrive ($4.99), but I wanted something else that is free (open source), easy to use, and has more features.<br />
'drive' is the solution. It is a command-line tool that lets you pull or push your Google Drive files. It works similar to 'git'. It was originally developed by <a href="https://github.com/rakyll">Jaana Burcu Dogan</a> and is now maintained by <a href="https:/github.com/odeke-em">Emmanuel T. Odeke</a>. <br />
I have found it very useful, and have been using it heavily. Please follow the steps listed below if you are interested in it as well.
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt install golang git mercurial
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/odeke-em/drive#requirements" target="_blank">Set up your GOPATH</a> (if not already set up). Here is how it can be done.
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
cat << ! >> ~/.bashrc
> export GOPATH=\$HOME/gopath
> export PATH=\$GOPATH:\$GOPATH/bin:\$PATH
> !
source ~/.bashrc
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Get the 'drive' from the github repo and set it up on my machine.
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
go get -u github.com/odeke-em/drive/cmd/drive
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Check if it has been successfully installed.
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
drive help
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Create a directory where you want to set your google drive. Let's say 'GDrive'
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir GDrive
cd GDrive
drive init
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
That's all you need to do. Your local google drive is all set and is ready to go. All you need to do now is push and pull your documents to and from your online Google Drive. Some of the most frequently used drive commands are:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
drive help                 # print out detailed list of commands available.
drive pull                 # pulls all the online contents to your local directory.
drive push                 # pushes all your local files to your online Google Drive.
drive pull filename        # pulls the file 'filename' to your local directory.
drive push filename        # pushes the file 'filename' to your online Google Drive.
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Enjoy.
